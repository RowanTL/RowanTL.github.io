![A picture of me](assets/pictures/so_ill_headshot.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}

I am a Computer Science Major graduated Summa Cum Laude from Missouri S&T. I like to climb rocks,
play video games, and experiment with different system administration aspects.

I've used Linux full time for five years.
