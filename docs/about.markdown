![A picture of me](assets/pictures/so_ill_headshot.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}

I am a Computer Science Major graduated Summa Cum Laude from Missouri S&T.

I've found enjoyment in many unique areas of Computer Science. For example, I've tried:
- Evolutionary Computing
  - PushGP to be precise
- Genome Sequence Error Correction
  - Mainly with LLMs
  - I have an appreciation for traditional algorithmic methods
- CNNs for Image Classification, Object Detection, and Image Segmentation
- Linux/OpenBSD for Server Hosting
- Learning New Programming Languages for Fun
  - Haskell
  - Rust

For fun I:
- Use Desktop Linux (for five years)
- Rock Climb
- Read Books
- De-Brainrotted (No Tiktok, Reels, Shorts, Reddit, ...)
