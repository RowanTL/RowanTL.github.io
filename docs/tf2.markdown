After watching a Team Fortress 2 video about [dead maps](https://youtu.be/z5nLt7ekUPk?si=xYf7ftLM2vlhcUyG), I wanted to put a server up dedicated to these old maps.
The server isn't up yet, but when I get a bit more time, I'm gonna put one up.

This gives me a good excuse to experiment with OpenBSD.

Server IP: TBD

List of Maps: TBD
