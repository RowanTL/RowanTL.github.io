For a time, I thought I was going back to school for a Finance BS. That fell through.

I needed to connect to Lindenwood's network, but there were no instructions
for Linux online. I ended up talking to an IT employee in person who called
the networking guy. I got the instructions then. The screenshots below show
how to connect.
